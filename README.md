# Gurt.

An awful name for a clever little Minecraft AI.

**Gurt** was forged in the firey depths of anarchy servers to bring order to chaos in the most adverse of conditions.

## Requirements:
### Java: 17
- Gurt uses [a modified version of baritone](https://github.com/InfiniteChaosLab/icl-baritone/tree/1.20.4) for navigation, and baritone only supports up to Java 17 at present.
